UT-Logging
==========

Experimenting and discovering logging with NLog and ASP .NET Core.


## Did add Some stuff to log to Seq

> âš  This is the most basic configuration.  
> For more advanced setup please visit [instructions @DockerHub](<https://hub.docker.com/r/datalust/seq>).


Be sure to remove the intentional spaces from the command left in  an *nlog.config* file comment.

Or copy it from there:

`docker run --name seq --rm -e ACCEPT_EULA=Y -v c:\temp:/data -p 5341:80 datalust/seq:latest`

Also tried a basic query.

> rndNb is the name of the structured log message variable for the random number represented in pink.  
> The date is also such variable and with a ditinguished colour.  
> Notice the tooltip (though mouse pointer is not visible).

We can also expand a log message to check detailed information.

This is the power to structured logging.
